## Why is it important to choose a license?
It is important to choose a license because this determines how the software will be used by the public. By finding the type of explicit permission users have with the code, you will have complete control over how your software is distributed. Not having a license at all is not advisable as anyone can do anything with your code. 

## Why you shouldn't use a project without an explicit license?
You should not use a project without an explicit license because the redistrbution rights for the project are not clear. There is no outline so contributing to the project is very difficult.

## Agree with the claim? 
I do agree with the claim because of Gopher's lack of support for hypertext. This, compared to the web, limited a user's experience and ultimately ended the use of Gopher. I also belive the bad publicity did contribute to the downfall of Gopher, much like Bing and internet explorer. 

## Android using Apache
 After reading their article, https://source.android.com/setup/start/licenses, Android developers chose this license because of their focus on visibility and being a true open-source software. A major barrier that the software faces was using LGPL. They state that, "In simplified terms, LGPL requires shipping of source to the application; a written offer for source; or linking the LGPL-ed library dynamically and allowing users to manually upgrade or replace the library. Android software is typically shipped as a static system image, so complying with these requirements restricts device manufacturer designs. For instance, it's difficult for a user to replace a library on read-only flash storage." By using the Apache license, the company is able to bypass this barrier.
